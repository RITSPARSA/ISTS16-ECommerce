>Should generate the team’s token based on user login credentials, so that it isn’t stored on disk and that way is harder to steal. Then introduce an appsec vuln to allow you to impersonate another user, or gain access to the app.

>This app should allow them to buy things from white team, but the public facing unauthenticated portion should allow people (probably us) to buy things from them to earn them some extra money.
